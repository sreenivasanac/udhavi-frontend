Udhavi - Disaster Management
=======================

Disaster management app
----------------  

What is your idea really about? (Keep it brief)
Simple Application for managing Rescue and Relief operations and for connecting people who are interested to help with people who are in need of help (like basic amenities and rescue) during Diasters (eg Chennai floods).
Amenities resource and human resource critical - better management
During Chennai floods, lots of people were affected and lots of volunteers were willing to help. The rescue and relief operations were primarily done by Facebook posts, whatsapp messages and Google Sheets - but we feel it wasn’t consolidated. There were stale information about someone in dire need, but turned out they have been rescued long back. There wasn’t realtime information on which places need the most help. Contacts (email, mobile numbers) of people willing to help were misused. Fake and stale information were spread.
Matching people who need rescue or basic amenities (food, medicine, water, clothes, blanket, blood) with people who are willing to help
URL very shareable. This will be source of truth. Even if we find another person in need in whatsapp or facebook post, a volunteer can add it in this app for further sharing.

Dashboard with people’s activity
Realtime location-based information and analytics of which locations need more help
Find nearby people to help
